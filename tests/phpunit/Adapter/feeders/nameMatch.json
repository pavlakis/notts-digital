Whilst positive change is often welcomed, we can sometimes become defensive in the face of a threat or sudden transition. Change is always subjective, whether to circumstance or person; changes such as project scope or requirements, a change in job role or responsibilities or even a change that threatens our job security.<\/p> <p>When shifts like this happen we can often feel like we're not in control of our emotional response. As we explore change and its emotional consequence, we'll look at a model that's easy to remember and apply. One that will enable you to assess your reaction when presented with change. We'll learn <b>why<\/b> we find change difficult and <b>how<\/b>, once aware, we can <b>change <\/b>the way we respond to it.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>About Paul<\/b><\/p> <p>I'm the team lead for the web team at Esendex. I also like recording podcasts and doing talks about emotional intelligence, helping people to live healthier and happier!<\/p> <p>\n\n\n<b>How to Talk: A guide to giving talks, presentations and public speaking<\/b><br\/><i>by Andrew Seward<\/i><\/p> <p>Are you nervous about speaking in front of others? Do you find yourself bashing out a powerpoint presentation the night before and hoping for the best? What you need is this crash course in preparing and giving great talks and presentations. Whether they be at work, at meetups or conferences, in 30 minutes Andrew Seward (<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/mrandrew?lang=en\">@MrAndrew<\/a>) will guide you through the finer points of putting together and delivering great presentations. We’ll also cover some good ideas for maximising the exposure when your talk is one of dozens on a conference schedule.<\/p> <p><br\/><b>About Andrew<\/b><\/p> <p>Andrew (<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/mrandrew?lang=en\">@MrAndrew<\/a>) is Head of Product at Cronofy and organiser of Tech Nottingham and Hack24.
